This is a web-based application developed using Java, JSP, Servlets, JDBC, and Oracle Database. 
The system allows adding new student records with automatic Student ID generation. 
Users can search for a student using roll number and admission date. It also provides an option to view all student records stored in the database. 
Student ID is generated using the admission date, roll number prefix, and database sequence. 
The application includes input validation and basic exception handling. This project runs on Apache Tomcat and uses Oracle XE as the backend database.
